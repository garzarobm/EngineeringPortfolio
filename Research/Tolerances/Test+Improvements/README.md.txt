#Tolerance Testing

Comprises of 3 tests (thus far) to get the accurate tolerance.

Currently, an approximate 0.5 tolerance is added for my Ender 3. Ender 3 Pro has not been tested.

#Purpose:
To get the most accuracy when printing 3D parts.

Default:
0.12 mm, 20% Density (Profile Included).

Q1: If we laid 2 concentric circles, what would be the correct space between (assuming with my printer and my filament) to ensure the print latches on to each other?

Rectangles:
Qa:What is the suitable tolerance to ensure something is snug around a stepper motor?
